# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML
# Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning algorithms. The model leverages historical patient data to make predictions, providing an invaluable tool for early detection and prevention.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

Model Training: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

Model Evaluation: Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User Interface: A simple interface for users to input their data and receive predictions.

# Dataset
